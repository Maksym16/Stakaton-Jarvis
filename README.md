Jarvis is a smart player!

Its use ML5.Posenet library:
- Ml5.js is described as friendly machine learning libary built on top of tensorflow.js, for handling mathematical operations and memory management for machine learning algorithms. Its  giving you access in the browser to pre-trained models such as Posenet.
- PoseNet is a machine learning model that allows for Real-time Human Pose Estimation, where key body joints are. PoseNet giving u output about x and y coordinates which can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses.
- I didnâ€™t use react and redux, because there are not a lot UI changes. I was a great chance to repeat DOM.
